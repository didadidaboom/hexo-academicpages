# About me
Over the last half year, Wu Chong has shifted his focus to his interest areas of data analysis, AI algorithms, and recommender systems without hurrying up to work and also exploring the internet area in a view of a full stack developer. To reach these goals, he accessed some open projects (黑马头条, etc.), which mostly relate to frameworks, such as Hadoop, Hive, Spark, SQL, PyTorch, etc. Meanwhile, he also started his own project "[BKMIST](https://github.com/didadidaboom/bkmist)", a social community released as a mini-program in Wechat, to let himself experience how a full-stack developer should do and think. His connection with the internet area goes checking more [here](/academicpages/#Internet-Experiences).

He made his decision to withdraw from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) at the end of the year 2021. Before that, he passed QE ([qualifying examination](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/sbs/admissions/programmes/graduate/research/programme-and-curriculum/ph.d.-candidature-confirmation-(qe))) and was named as a Ph.D. candidate, supervised by [Asst Prof Chan Wai Lee](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00198), working on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that requires the abilities to acquire programming languages quickly and to explore different open source frameworks. He obtained his degree of M.E. in 2018 from the School of Energy and Power Engineering at Beihang University with his work in the CFD area. He received his degrees of B.E. from Nanchang Hangkong University in 2014.

# Interest Areas

+ Data analysis
+ AI algorithms
+ recommender system

# Internet Experiences

+ 2022.07-2022.07  Constructed personal blog with Hexo

  (Utilized the Hexo theme template and modified its layout; https://didadidaboom.github.io/blog ) 

+ 2022.07-2022.07  Wrapped **Hadoop ecosystem** and its components by **docker**

  (Wrote my own Dockerfile to wrap Hadoop components, which can be used to construct recommender system; Docker found by searching Dockerhub ID: didadidaboom; and docker file found at GitHub https://github.com/didadidaboom )

+ 2022.03-2022.06  Learnt **neural networks** theory systematically and practiced it by **PyTorch**

  (Understand how the neural networks work and some basic steps, such as feature engineering, model evaluation, sampling, and optimization; Practiced some basic neural networks, including deep feedforward networks, RNN, and Gan; Followed a paper and wrote its corresponding algorithm)

+ 2022.02-2022.03  Repeated an open project - “Recommend System: 黑马头条”

  (Practiced **Hadoop ecosystem** and their components including **Hadoop, Hive, Yarn, Sqoop, Spark**; Learned how the recommender algorithms developed from item-based and user-based recommendation to model-based recommendation)

+ 2021.12-2022.02   Started a Mini-program project “BKMIST”, which is a social community and was published on the top of previous Mini-program “圈子”

  (The whole project was finished by myself, including concept design, database design, UI design, frontend (Javascript) development, backend (python, Django Rest framework) development, and cloud server deployment; Project found at https://github.com/didadidaboom/bkmist and https://github.com/didadidaboom/bkmist-frontend )

+ 2020.05-2020.12  Organization of the development of a social App “圈子”

  (Including concept design, the product requirement written, and recruitment of members)

+ 2017.05-2017.10  Organization of the development of the auxiliary software for a trading platform

  (Including fundraising(in private), product requirement, recruitment of members, and organization of the developers)
